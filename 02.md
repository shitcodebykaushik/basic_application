# Detailed Info about Flutter 
```Flutter run ``` Is the command for running the flutter application .
 Any thing with blue underline is a warning .
 Any thing with red underline is a error .
 Stack trace allow us to know where the error is in our application .
 In flutter every component is widget .


Tip use vscode-icon extensions for the development of the clear instruction.
 We car importing the matrial.dart file  from the flutter package .
 ```import 'package:flutter/material.dart';```
 The main purpose of importing the matrail .dart file is that it will give the all function classes and methond we can use in flutter.

 - runnApp (app) 
   - This is imported from flutter.
   - Inflate the given widget and attach it on the screen.
- Widget
  - At the end of the day widget is  class 
  - Widget are the building block of  the  UI
 .It is responsible for describing what UI   should  look like .
    Widget can be any UI component.
- State 
  It refers to the data that determine how widget should look like. 
    - Type of widget
      1. StatelessWidget In this data is immutable means that one widget is created it will not change . At  the end of the day it is abstract class .
      2. Statefull Widget In this data can be changed which means it is mutable .
      3. Inherited Widget 

    - Widget require key for its consturctor .

- Text direction 
   - It is a enum .It can have two value that rtl or etl .Which means it can go from left tp right or right to left .
 The purpose of declaring ```const``` constructor is a compile time constructor .
 Before returin any widget we gotta use const .
```KEY``` is a class that helps flutter  to differentiate between widget. By passing key to the constructoe  we speicifically  key to the specific widget .
```Dart
//Basic program for the implementation 
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fkutter/cupertino.dart';

void main (){
  runApp(const Kaushik ());
}
class   Kaushik extends StatelessWidget {
  const Kaushik ({super.key});
 @override
 Widget build (BuildContext context){
  return 
  const Text('hi',textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,);

 }

}
```
